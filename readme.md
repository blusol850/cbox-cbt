# Welcome to the ColdBox Templating Language

The ColdBox templating language is inspired by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and implemented on top of the Java Engine Pebble - http://www.mitchellbosecke.com/pebble/.  This templating language will allow you to leverage the ColdBox conventions and MVC methodology to your view layer and completely decouple yourself from any CFML in your views.

The ColdBox Templating Engine is fully featured and adheres to the Twig syntax and Pebble Extensions.

####HONOR GOES TO GOD ABOVE ALL
Because of His grace, this project exists. If you don't like this, then don't read it, its not for you.

>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5

###THE DAILY BREAD
 > "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me (JESUS)" Jn 14:1-12
